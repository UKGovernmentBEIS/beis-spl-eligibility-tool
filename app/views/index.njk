        Use this tool to check if you or your partner can get <a href="#">shared parental leave and pay</a> in the first year of your child‘s life
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check eligibility for each parent individually, but in either case you‘ll need to answer questions on work and earnings for <strong>both</strong> parents.
